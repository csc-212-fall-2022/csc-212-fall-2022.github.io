## FAQ

**Q**: What topics/material am I responsible for?<br>
**A**: Class material through Depth First Search and assignment 5.

**Q**: What resources may I use during the exam?<br>
**A**: As with exam 1, you may bring on 8 1/2 x 11in page of notes. You will hand in your notes with your exam. (I'll give them back--having access when I'm grading means I have an easy way to know why you and your study partner wrote the same answer.)

**Q**: Will there be a practice/sample exam again?
**A**: Probably not. 

**Q**: What sort of questions will be on the exam?
**A**: Much like last time, expect to:
- explain trade-offs (why would we do X and not Y in situation ABC?)
- modify one of the algorithms we've seen to solve a problem
- use the data structures we've seen to solve a problem

## Definitions/Concepts

- traversals of binary search trees
    - pre-order
    - in-order
    - post-order
- successor/predecessor in a binary search tree
- height of a tree
- graphs (see appendix B.4 in the book)
    - undirected graph
    - directed graph
    - cycle
        - DAG: directed acyclic graph
    - degree/in-degree/out-degree
    - connected component
    - complete graph
    - bipartite graph

## Data Structures

- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps
    - max-heapify
- Priority Queues
- Graph (directed/undirected)
    - adjacency lists
    - adjacency matrix

## Algorithms

- Heap sort
- Quicksort
    - We talked about two different partitioning schemes. I will *not* ask you about Hoare partitioning.
    If you need to implement quicksort on the exam, you may use whatever version you like.
- Counting sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
