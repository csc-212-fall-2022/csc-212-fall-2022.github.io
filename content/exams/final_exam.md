## FAQ

**Q**: When is the final?</br>
**A** Thursday, December 15, 8am-10.15. NAC 5/102 (the regular classroom).

**Q**: May I bring a page of notes? </br>
**A**: Yes, same as the prior exams, you may bring one 8 1/2 x 11in page of notes.

**Q**: If something isn't on this list, am I responsible for it?
**A**: Yes. (Though, in full disclosure, I use the list as an aid in writing the exam.)

## Things to be Prepared For
- Defining terms
- Explaining the tradeoff between two implementations of a data structure (eg open addressing vs chaining in a hash table)
- Knowing the assumptions of/preconditions for using an algorithm
- Applying/modifying one of the algorithms we've seen to solve a problem
